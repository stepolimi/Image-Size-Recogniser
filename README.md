# Image-Size-Recogniser

The goal of this project is to implement an HW component in VHDL which, given an image in greyscale, calculates the area of the minimal rectangle that circumscribes totally a figure of interest present in the image.

This was made as a bachelor thesis project for a course held in italian, so all the documantation is totally in that language.
